The data for this project was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/diabetes-data-set. I used machine learning models as well as tensorflow to calculate the probability that someone has diabetes. I used 6 models: LogisticRegression, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, LinearSVC, Naive Bayes as well as hypertuned the models with the best promise.

I also used Tensorflow to calculate the accuracy of the model predicting that someone has diabetes.
